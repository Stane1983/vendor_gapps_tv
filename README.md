# vendor_gapps_tv

**GApps for android TV devices**

Build standalone zips
-------------------

You can compile your GApps package with GNU make

_make distclean_
- Remove output directory

_make gapps_tv_arm_
- compile signed flashable GApps for arm

_make gapps_tv_arm64_
- compile signed flashable GApps for arm64

Build inline with Android
-------------------
1. Sync this repo to `$GAPPS_PATH` where `$GAPPS_PATH` is the path to this repo
2. Include `$GAPPS_PATH/$ARCH/$ARCH-vendor.mk` where `$ARCH` is arm, or arm64 depending on the device's architecture

Example:

`GAPPS_ARCH := arm`

`$(call inherit-product, vendor/gapps_tv/$(GAPPS_ARCH)/$(GAPPS_ARCH)-vendor.mk)`
